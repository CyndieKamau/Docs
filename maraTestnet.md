# CONNECTING MARA TESTNET TO METAMASK

In the previous tutorial we created a new  Metamask wallet. Here we will now connect our Metamask wallet to the `mara-testnet` network;

By default Metamask will be configured to the Ethereum mainnet. We will add the Mara Testnet manually;

In settings first ensure the `Show Test Networks` is `ON`.

The `ON` button is to ensure that Metamask can detect both main networks (such as Ethereum mainnet), and test networks (such as Goerli testnet, mara-testnet etc);

Once that's done we can now add `mara-testnet` manually; Click on the `Add a network` button;

Once that's done you can now add details of the `mara-testnet` network, as follows;

The details are below;


### Network Name;         mara-testnet

### RPC URL;              https://mara-testnet.calderachain.xyz/http

### Chain ID;             123456

### Currency Symbol;      MARA

### Block Explorer URL;   https://mara-testnet.calderaexplorer.xyz/


Once that's done click on `Save`, and voila! We've added the `mara-testnet` to our Metamask wallet. We will use it when deploying our smart contract to the MARA testnet.

You can now switch to mara-testnet;
