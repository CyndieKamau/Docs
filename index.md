## Connecting MARA Testnet to Metamask

Metamask is a digital wallet and bridge that connects users to the decentralized web.

It is a browser extension available for Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Brave browsers, and as a standalone mobile app on iOS and Android. 

MetaMask allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, as well as Ethereum-compatible blockchains like MARA, and manage their digital assets from the convenience of their browser or mobile device.

## 1. CREATING A METAMASK WALLET

Go to Chrome Web store and search for Metamask;

Click on `Add to Brave/Chrome` button;

![addbrave](https://github.com/CyndieKamau/Docs/assets/63792575/ff83b379-c6e2-4aed-a41c-1c7bbfc9d8f3)


You’ll be directed to Metamask’s home page; Read the policies, select I agree, then click on the `Create a new Wallet` button;

![start2](https://github.com/CyndieKamau/Docs/assets/63792575/8bdbacb7-1447-4334-8b02-6a3124bee9b4)


You will be prompted to create a new password;

Once you've entered your password you can now click on `Create a new wallet` button;



**N.B** It's important to watch the video on how to secure your wallet; Watch the video first before clicking on the `Secure my wallet` button;

**IMPORTANT: Copy the Recovery Phrase and store it somewhere safe, and don't share it with anyone. You’ll be prompted to confirm the Recovery Phrase, once you reveal the Recovery Phrase, and copy it.**

And with that, you’ve successfully created your metamask wallet!!!

## 2. CONNECTING MARA TESTNET TO METAMASK

In the previous tutorial we created a new  Metamask wallet. Here we will now connect our Metamask wallet to the `mara-testnet` network;


By default Metamask will be configured to the Ethereum mainnet. We will add the Mara Testnet manually;


In settings first ensure the `Show Test Networks` is `ON`.

![settings](https://github.com/CyndieKamau/Docs/assets/63792575/d80e42b4-3c04-44cc-b9af-442e51890a65)


The `ON` button is to ensure that Metamask can detect both main networks (such as Ethereum mainnet), and test networks (such as Goerli testnet, mara-testnet etc);


Once that's done we can now add `mara-testnet` manually; Click on the `Add a network` button;


![addnet](https://github.com/CyndieKamau/Docs/assets/63792575/8c761861-f843-4e36-b20a-f23fac01164d)


Once that's done you can now add details of the `mara-testnet` network, as follows;


![net](https://github.com/CyndieKamau/Docs/assets/63792575/d4e73493-81a2-4d58-93d7-167b884f402a)


The details are below;


---
### Network Name;         mara-testnet

### RPC URL;              https://mara-testnet.calderachain.xyz/http

### Chain ID;             123456

### Currency Symbol;      MARA

### Block Explorer URL;   https://mara-testnet.calderaexplorer.xyz/
---


Once that's done click on `Save`, and voila! We've added the `mara-testnet` to our Metamask wallet. We will use it when deploying our smart contract to the MARA testnet.


You can now switch to mara-testnet;
