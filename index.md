## Connecting MARA Testnet to Metamask

Metamask is a digital wallet and bridge that connects users to the decentralized web.

It is a browser extension available for Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Brave browsers, and as a standalone mobile app on iOS and Android. 

MetaMask allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, as well as Ethereum-compatible blockchains like MARA, and manage their digital assets from the convenience of their browser or mobile device.
