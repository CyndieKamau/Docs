# Building on Mara
## Front-end integration with Mara
By following these steps, you can integrate your frontend to Mara testnet and test your application before deploying it to the mainnet.

    1. **Chose the testnet** that is the Mara testnet
    2. **Set up a testnet node:** To connect to a testnet, you will need to set up a node that is connected to the testnet. You can either run a node locally on your machine or use a cloud-based provider. Ensure that your node is fully synced with the testnet.
