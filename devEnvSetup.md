# SETTING UP HARDHAT

Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment, ideal for developers who aim to create smart contracts or DApps. 

It simplifies the process by providing a platform for testing, debugging, and deployment, offering a more streamlined development experience.


## PRE-REQUISITES

To begin interacting with hardhat, the following need to be setup;

`nodejs`.

`npm`

To setup `nodejs` and `npm`, follow these instructions [here.](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

For successful installation, checking the node and npm version should give you this;

```
hp@Cyndie:~$ npm -v
9.1.3
hp@Cyndie:~$ node -v
v18.16.0
hp@Cyndie:~$ 

```
## 1. INSTALLING HARDHAT

We'll now install hardhat to setup our environment for deploying our smart contract on the `mara-testnet`;

### Initialize `npm`
  
 We'll first create an empty directory (you can also clone your desired github repository). I called mine `maracontract`;
 
 You can now open the directory in your desired IDE, can be VSCode or Remix IDE. For this tutorial we'll use VSCode.
 
We'll first initialize `npm` by running the `npm init` command inside our `maracontract` directory;

```
root@Cyndie:/home/hp/Desktop/maracontract# npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.
package name: (maracontract) 
version: (1.0.0) 
description: deploying test smart contract on mara-testnet
entry point: (index.js) 
test command: 
git repository: 
keywords: mara-testnet
author: Cyndie
license: (ISC) 
About to write to /home/hp/Desktop/maracontract/package.json:

{
  "name": "maracontract",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "deploying test smart contract on mara-testnet",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "mara-testnet"
  ],
  "author": "Cyndie",
  "license": "ISC"
}


Is this OK? (yes) 
root@Cyndie:/home/hp/Desktop/maracontract# npm install --global hardhat
```
As you can see above, it walks you through a series of questions so as to generate an appropriate `package.json` file;

```
package name:
version:
description:
entry point:
test command:
git repository:
keywords:
author:
license:

```
You can skip through this section if you would like to tailor the `package.json` file much more. 

### Install hardhat

Once `npm` is initialized, we can now install hardhat globally using this command;

`npm install --global hardhat`

Successful installation should show something like this;

```
changed 323 packages in 43s

76 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details
```

**NB** If you come across such an error while installing hardhat, try running the command again as root;

```
....
npm ERR! Error: EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/usr/local/lib/node_modules/hardhat'
npm ERR!  [Error: EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/usr/local/lib/node_modules/hardhat'] {
npm ERR!   errno: -13,
npm ERR!   code: 'EACCES',
npm ERR!   syscall: 'mkdir',
npm ERR!   path: '/usr/local/lib/node_modules/hardhat'
npm ERR! }
npm ERR! 
npm ERR! The operation was rejected by your operating system.
npm ERR! It is likely you do not have the permissions to access this file as the current user
npm ERR! 
npm ERR! If you believe this might be a permissions issue, please double-check the
npm ERR! permissions of the file and its containing directories, or try running
npm ERR! the command again as root/Administrator.
....
```
And with that we have installed hardhat!! We can now go to step 2.

## 2. CREATING A NEW HARDHAT PROJECT

While still in the `maracontract` directory, we'll now create a new hardhat project using the `npx hardhat` command;
